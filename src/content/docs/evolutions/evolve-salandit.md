title: Evolve Salandit
description: A goal for evolving a Salandit into Salazzle.

This goal requires you to evolve a Salandit into Salazzle at level 33.
The trick to this goal is that only female Salandit can evolve.

### Strategy

Salandit only spawn in caves, so you want to find the largest cave to encourage multiple spawns.
It is a common spawn, so if you have a large enough cave (e.g. the entrance to **Dalizapa Passage**) it should be easy to find a female one.
In case you don't find a female in your first batch, you can force wild Pok√©mon to respawn by having a picnic.

**Dalizapa Passage** should be your preferred catching location, since you will find Salandit ready for evolution there.
