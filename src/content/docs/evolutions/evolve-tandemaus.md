title: Evolve Tandemaus
description: A goal for evolving a Tandemaus into a Maushold.
---

This goal requires you to evolve a Tandemaus into a Maushold.
Tandemaus can evolve by levelup during a fight starting at level 25.
Tandemaus doesn't need to be sent out to evolve.
If it is in your party, it might evolve without the evolution animation.

## Strategies

### Capture early

Tandemaus are available for capturing in **The Pokémon League** and easily capturable with a Pokéball.
Continuing on your run, your Tandemaus will level up and will reach level 25 with enough time and experience points.

### Capture late

Tandemaus are available later, e.g. near **Medali**.
Capturing one near or over level 25 massively decreases the time you need to spend with it in your party.
