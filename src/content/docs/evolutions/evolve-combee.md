title: Evolve Combee
description: A goal for evolving a Combee into Vespiquen.
---

This goal requires you to evolve a Combee into Vespiquen at level 21.
The trick to this goal is that only female Combee can evolve.

### Strategy

You can find Combee that are ready for evolution in **West Province (Area One)**,
just south of **Asado Desert**. If you don't find any female Combee at first,
you can force wild Pok√©mon to respawn by having a picnic.
