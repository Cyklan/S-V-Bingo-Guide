import Pokemon from "../../../components/Pokemon.astro";

This goal requires you to evolve a regular <Pokemon name="Wooper" /> into a <Pokemon name="Quagsire" />.
The only way to obtain <Pokemon name="Quagsire" /> is by receiving <Pokemon name="Wooper" /> through an [in-game trade](/in-game-trades/in-game-trades/#trade-a-paldean-wooper-for-a-wooper) and leveling it up twice.
