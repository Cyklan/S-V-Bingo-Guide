import Map from "../../../components/Map.astro";

This goal requires you to evolve an Eevee.

### Location

There is a static encounter for an Eevee on the Flamigo setup route.

<Map location={[-439.7250003814697, 298.46875]} zoom={3} markers={[{
  location: [-433.5, 296.46875]
}]} />

### Strategy

The fastest way to evolve an Eevee is probably by evolution stone.

You might, however, consider doing a friendship evolution if you also have the [Friendship Evolution](#) goal.

You can pick up up a Fire Stone from **Sparkling Dropped Items** in **East Province (Area Three)**.

#### Water Stone

Behind the Cascarrafa Gym Building is a waterfall with two shores.
On one shore sits an Ominous Black Stake, and on the other, a Water Stone.

#### Leaf Stone

The easiest way to get a leaf stone is by hadding to **Tagtree Thicket** and grabbing it near a cliff. Be sure to come in from the North to avoid a cutscene. 
You can also get a guaranteed Leaf Stone by finding **10 Sunflora** in Artazon by rerunning **Sunflora Hide and Seek** after beating Brassius and obtaining the Artazon Gym Badge.
