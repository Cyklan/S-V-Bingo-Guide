title: Evolve Combee
description: A goal for evolving a Combee into Vespiquen.

import Pokemon from "../../../components/Pokemon.astro";

This goal requires you to evolve a <Pokemon name="Combee" /> into <Pokemon name="Vespiquen" /> at level 21.
The trick to this goal is that only female <Pokemon name="Combee" /> can evolve.

### Strategy

You can find <Pokemon name="Combee" /> pretty reliably in **South Province (Area Two)** around **Cortondo**.
If you don't find any female <Pokemon name="Combee" /> at first,
you can force wild Pok√©mon to respawn by having a picnic.
