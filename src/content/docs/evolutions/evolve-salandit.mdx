title: Evolve Salandit
description: A goal for evolving a Salandit into Salazzle.

import Pokemon from "../../../components/Pokemon.astro";

This goal requires you to evolve a <Pokemon name="Salandit" /> into <Pokemon name="Salazzle" /> at level 33.
The trick to this goal is that only female <Pokemon name="Salandit" /> can evolve.

### Strategy

<Pokemon name="Salandit" /> only spawn in caves, so you want to find the largest
cave to encourage multiple spawns. It is a common spawn, so if you have a large enough
cave (e.g. the entrance to **Dalizapa Passage**) it should be easy to find a female
one. In case you don't find a female in your first batch, you can force wild Pok√©mon
to respawn by having a picnic.

**Dalizapa Passage** should be your preferred catching location, since you will find <Pokemon name="Salandit" /> ready for evolution there.
