This goal requires you to evolve a <Pokemon name="Charcadet" /> into either an <Pokemon name="Armarouge" /> or an <Pokemon name="Ceruledge" />,
depending on which version you're playing.

## Obtaining Charcadet

The best way to catch <Pokemon name="Charcadet" /> is by encountering it at a set spawn location in **South Province (Area Three)**.

<Map location={[-400, 300]} zoom={3} markers={[{
  location: [-396, 293]
}]} />

## Evolving Charcadet

<Pokemon name="Charcadet" />s evolution is triggered by a held item, which can
be obtained by trading it with an NPC in Zapapico. The item the NPC wants is
dependent on the version you're playing.

<Map
  location={[-275, 330]}
  zoom={3}
  markers={[
    {
      location: [-267, 319],
    },
  ]}
/>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bronzor Fragments (Scarlet)">
    The NPC wants you to obtain 10 Bronzor Fragments for trading. In return they
    will give you an Auspicious Armor. You obtain Bronzor Fragments by defeating
    <Pokemon name="Bronzor" /> either in battle or in roaming mode.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Sinistea Chips (Violet)">
    The NPC wants you to obtain 10 Sinistea Chips for trading. In return they
    will give you an Malicious Armor. You obtain Sinistea Chips by defeating
