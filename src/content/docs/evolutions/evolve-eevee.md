#### Water Stone

Behind the Cascarrafa Gym Building is a waterfall with two shores.
On one shore sits an Ominous Black Stake, and on the other, a Water Stone.

#### Leaf Stone

The easiest way to get a leaf stone is by hadding to **Tagtree Thicket** and grabbing it near a cliff. Be sure to come in from the North to avoid a cutscene. 
You can also get a guaranteed Leaf Stone by finding **10 Sunflora** in Artazon by rerunning **Sunflora Hide and Seek** after beating Brassius and obtaining the Artazon Gym Badge.
