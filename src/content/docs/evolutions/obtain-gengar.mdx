description: A goal that requires you to obtain a Gengar.

import Pokemon from "../../../components/Pokemon.astro";

This goal requires you to evolve a <Pokemon name="Haunter" /> into a <Pokemon name="Gengar" />.
The only way to obtain <Pokemon name="Gengar" /> is by receiving <Pokemon name="Haunter" /> through an [in-game trade](/in-game-trades/in-game-trades/#trade-a-pincurchin-for-a-haunter), as it is a trade evolution.
