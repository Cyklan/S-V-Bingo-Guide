title: Evolve Tandemaus
description: A goal for evolving a Tandemaus into a Maushold.
---

import Pokemon from "../../../components/Pokemon.astro";

This goal requires you to evolve a <Pokemon name="Tandemaus" /> into a <Pokemon name="maushold-family-of-four" displayName="Maushold" />.
<Pokemon name="Tandemaus" /> can evolve by levelup during a fight starting at level 25.
<Pokemon name="Tandemaus" /> doesn't need to be sent out to evolve.
If it is in your party, it might evolve without the evolution animation.

## Strategies

### Capture early

<Pokemon name="Tandemaus" /> are available for capturing in **The Pokémon League** and easily capturable with a Pokéball.
Continuing on your run, your <Pokemon name="Tandemaus" /> will level up and will reach level 25 with enough time and experience points.

### Capture late

<Pokemon name="Tandemaus" /> are available later, e.g. near **Medali**.
Capturing one near or over level 25 massively decreases the time you need to spend with it in your party.
