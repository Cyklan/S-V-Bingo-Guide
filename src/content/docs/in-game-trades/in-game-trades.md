### Trade a Pincurchin for a Haunter

**Location**: Levincia
In Levincia, in the middle part by the battle court is a trainer who will ask for a Pincurchin.
In exchange, they will give you a Haunter (Lv. 25). Since this Haunter is not holding any items, it will evolve.
You don't have to actually do the evolution for it to count towards the ingame-trade goal.
