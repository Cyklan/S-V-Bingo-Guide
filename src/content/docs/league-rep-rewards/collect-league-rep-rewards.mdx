description: A goal for gathering a certain number of titan badges.
---

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This goal requires you to collect either **one**, **two** or **three** rewards from Battle League Representatives.
You can find them outside of Pok√©mon centers. There is one League Rep per area of the game.
You get a reward after defeating a certain amount of trainers in a given area.

## Strategy

While there are many League Reps, there are a bunch of goals that require you to get a specific reward.
If you have both the generic and the specific goals, it might be worth combining them.
