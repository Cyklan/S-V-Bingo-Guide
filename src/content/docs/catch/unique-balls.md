title: Pokémon in Unique Balls
description: A goal requiring to capture multiple Pokémon using different kinds of balls
---

This goal requires you to capture **four**, **five**, **six** or **seven** Pokémon in unique Pokéballs.
As an example, having caught Pokémon in a Poké Ball, a Great Ball, a Quick Ball and a Dive Ball would complete the goal for capturing Pokémon in four unique balls.
The Pokémon don't need to be unique, though.

## Strategy

You're always starting this goal with one ball out of the way, because your starter Pokémon is in a Poké Ball.
If you're performing the Flamigo starting route you're also alreayd guaranteed a Pokémon in a Quick Ball.
Following the Flamigo starting route should also provide you with enough balls that are on the way for you to be able to quickly complete this goal.
