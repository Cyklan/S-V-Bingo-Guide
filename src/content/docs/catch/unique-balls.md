title: Pokémon in Unique Balls
description: A goal requiring to capture multiple Pokémon using different kinds of balls
---

This goal requires you to capture **four**, **five**, **six** or **seven** Pokémon in unique Pokéballs.
As an example, having caught Pokémon in a Poké Ball, a Great Ball, a Quick Ball and a Dive Ball would complete the goal for capturing Pokémon in four unique balls.
The Pokémon don't need to be unique, though.

## Strategy

You're always starting this goal with one ball out of the way, because your starter Pokémon is in a Poké Ball.
If you're performing the Flamigo starting route you're also already guaranteed a Pokémon in a Quick Ball. In addition, there is an Ultra Ball and Luxury Ball conveniently located on the way to the Flamigo, putting you at 4 unique Poké Balls. Following the Flamigo starting route should also provide you with enough balls that are on the way for you to be able to quickly complete this goal.

Some easily obtainable ones include:
- A Repeat Ball northwest of the Stony Titan in East Province (Area One) near the TM for Venoshock
- A Net Ball in a grove directly north of the previous Repeat Ball
- A Timer Ball near the start of Glaseado Mountain (South) when following the EXP Candy route
