description: A goal that requires you to capture all five forms of Flabébé
---

import Map from "../../../components/Map.astro";

This goal requires you to capture **five** forms of Flabébé.
Flabébé forms are differentiated by color, with each color having a different spawn chance.
The colors available are:

- red
- yellow
- orange
- blue
- white

## Location

A common spawn location for Flabébé is to the **West** of the **Open Sky Titan** in **West Province (Area One)**.

<Map
  location={[-340, 39]}
  zoom={3}
  markers={[
    {
      location: [-331.7, 38.5],
    },
    {
      location: [-334, 37.5],
    },
    {
      location: [-342, 40],
    },
  ]}
/>

Another common spawn location is **South** of **Cortondo**, close to the Ocean.

<Map
  location={[-466, 191]}
  zoom={3}
  markers={[
    {
      location: [-464, 196],
    },
    {
      location: [-460, 194],
    },
    {
      location: [-456, 189],
    },
    {
      location: [-458.5, 189],
    },
    {
      location: [-457.25, 190],
    },
    {
      location: [-458.5, 187],
    },
  ]}
/>

## Strategy

Flabébé has a 50% spawn chance in that area by default, which only guarantees the spawn of _any_ Flabébé.
You might still need to reroll for specific colors by having a picnic.<br />
To increase Flabébé Spawns you can buy a **Fruit Punch** at [**Go-For-Broke Grill** in Mesagoza](https://mapgenie.io/pokemon-scarlet-violet/maps/paldea-region?locationIds=217824).
This will give you a Lv. 1 Fairy Encounter boost for 30 minutes.
