import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This goal requires you to beat the Open Sky Titan and to obtain the badge from Arven.
The titan is a giant Bombirdier found near the three wind turbines in **West Province (Area One)**.
Beating this titan rewards you with the **Swim Ability** for your mount.

<Aside type="caution">
  You might be tempted to check off this goal after defeating the titan. This
  would be a timing error. The earliest you can check off this goal is as soon
  as the badge for beating the titan appears on screen.
