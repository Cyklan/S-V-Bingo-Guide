import { LinkCard, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This goal requires you to collect either **two** or **three** titan badges.

<Aside type="caution">
  You might be tempted to check off this goal after defeating the titan. This
  would be a timing error. The earliest you can check off this goal is as soon
  as the badge for beating the titan appears on screen.
