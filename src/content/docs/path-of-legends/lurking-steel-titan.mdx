This goal requires you to beat the Lurking Steel Titan and to obtain the badge from Arven.
The titan is a giant <Pokemon name="Orthworm" /> found near the tower in **East Province (Area Three)**.
Beating this titan rewards you with the **High Jump Ability** for your mount.

<Aside type="caution">
  You might be tempted to check off this goal after defeating the titan. This
  would be a timing error. The earliest you can check off this goal is as soon
  as the badge for beating the titan appears on screen.
